# SampleCarFinder
Sample Car Finder Project

This is revolving around Amadeus Car Finder Endpoint :

1. The Endpoint can not accept large lat, lon, radius values and crashes
2. Due to lack of any actual Car brand name and despite any image provided by the endpoint I chose to not show a random mock up image 
that could result in confusing the user.
3. If the same parameters for the endpointed are fetched multiple times, there is a high chance the data that comes back is not the same in size or content
hence you may see some discrepencies in the data.
4. For Testing I included for UI Test using Espresso and one endpoint test using Robolectric
5. The EditText boxes are Custom Views created by me, however I reduced its functionality by half since not all of its functionality was needed 
for this assignment.
6. The Project is written in Kotlin, but I have profficiency in Java as well even though Kotlin in my opinion is a more superior choice.
